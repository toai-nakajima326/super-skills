# Ship Release

## Rules

- verify before release steps
- review before push or PR
- sync docs with shipped behavior
- do not auto-commit or auto-push by default

## Workflow

1. Run verification.
2. Review the diff and release risk.
3. Update release-facing docs.
4. Prepare branch, commit message, and PR summary.
