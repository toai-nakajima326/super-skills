# Investigate

## Rules

- no speculative fixes
- gather evidence before changing code
- separate observations, hypotheses, and fixes

## Workflow

1. Reproduce the issue and capture exact symptoms.
2. Trace the real execution path.
3. Form the smallest plausible root-cause hypothesis.
4. Verify the hypothesis against code or runtime evidence.
5. Only then propose or implement a fix.
