# Super Skills Unified Spec

## Purpose

Build a unified skill framework in this repository by combining the strongest workflow patterns from `ref/gstack` and the strongest modular packaging, Codex, MCP, and multi-agent patterns from `ref/everything-claude-code`.

The result should be:

- Workflow-strong like gstack
- Modular and installable like ECC
- Codex-first in structure
- Security-first by default
- Extensible to plugins, MCP profiles, and multi-agent roles

## Source Inputs

Primary references:

- `ref/gstack`
- `ref/everything-claude-code`

Primary integration surfaces:

- `skills/`
- `.agents/skills/`
- `.codex/`
- `mcp/`
- `plugins/`
- `manifests/`
- `scripts/`

## Design Principles

### 1. Workflow density over catalog sprawl

Adopt gstack's strongest end-to-end workflows for planning, debugging, QA, review, security, and release operations.

### 2. Modular packaging over monolith

Adopt ECC's modular manifests, install profiles, Codex config structure, and agent role layout so the system can be installed in slices instead of as an all-or-nothing bundle.

### 3. Codex-first artifact model

The repository should treat human-authored `skills/` as the source of truth and generate Codex-facing `.agents/skills/` metadata from that source.

The same shared `skills/` source should also be installable for Claude Code without forking workflow content. Claude support should package shared skills into a Claude-native directory layout rather than maintaining a second authored skill tree.

### 4. Security-first defaults

No auto-executing telemetry, auto-upgrade, auto-commit, auto-routing injection, or broad MCP enablement should be enabled by default.

### 5. Lean defaults, explicit expansion

The default install should be small and safe. Research, browser automation, external APIs, and host-specific plugins should be opt-in profiles.

## What To Adopt From gstack

Adopt these workflow ideas and translate them into unified skills:

- `office-hours`
- `plan-ceo-review`
- `plan-design-review`
- `plan-eng-review`
- `investigate`
- `review`
- `qa`
- `qa-only`
- `ship`
- `document-release`
- `health`
- `cso`
- `careful`
- `freeze`
- `guard`
- `checkpoint`

Adopt these implementation concepts:

- Template or generated-skill pipeline
- Strong skill descriptions and invocation intent
- Safety boundaries for destructive commands and scoped edits
- End-to-end browser-centric QA workflows
- Release workflow that ties verification, review, docs, and PR flow together

Do not adopt as default behavior:

- Telemetry preambles
- Upgrade-check preambles
- Auto-upgrade behavior
- Automatic CLAUDE.md routing injection
- Skill-side automatic commits
- Saving secrets to custom plaintext files when environment variables suffice

## What To Adopt From ECC

Adopt these structural patterns:

- `.codex/config.toml` baseline
- `.codex/agents/*.toml` role definitions
- `.agents/skills/<skill>/SKILL.md` plus `agents/openai.yaml`
- `manifests/install-components.json`
- `manifests/install-profiles.json`
- MCP cataloging and profile thinking
- Research and external-tool skills
- Codex-oriented AGENTS guidance

Adopt these skill families as modular knowledge packs:

- `tdd-workflow`
- `security-review`
- `verification-loop`
- `coding-standards`
- `backend-patterns`
- `frontend-patterns`
- `api-design`
- `e2e-testing`
- `documentation-lookup`
- `deep-research`
- `exa-search`
- `dmux-workflows`
- `mcp-server-patterns`

Adopt these platform patterns selectively:

- Multi-agent roles: `explorer`, `reviewer`, `docs-researcher`
- Lean Codex MCP baseline
- Install profiles such as `core`, `developer`, `security`, `research`

Do not adopt as default behavior:

- Broad default MCP enablement
- Auto-approval behavior from OpenCode plugins
- Hook-heavy runtime assumptions that do not map cleanly to Codex
- Large default install surface

## Installer Specification

### Installer goals

The repository must support installing a safe subset of the unified system into a target environment without copying the entire repository by default.

The installer must support:

- dry-run planning
- profile-based install
- component-based install
- target-specific install
- idempotent re-run
- validation before apply
- explicit opt-in for risky capabilities

### Installer surfaces

The system should expose:

- `scripts/install-plan.*`
- `scripts/install-apply.*`
- `scripts/install-validate.*`
- `scripts/list-installables.*`

If a single entrypoint is added later, it should wrap these functions instead of replacing them.

### Installer inputs

The installer must accept:

- `--profile <name>`
- `--with <component>`
- `--without <component>`
- `--target <target>`
- `--dry-run`
- `--json`
- `--config <path>`

Optional future inputs:

- `--force`
- `--upgrade`
- `--repair`

### Installer outputs

The planner must produce:

- selected modules
- selected components
- skipped modules
- target paths
- files to be copied or generated
- files that would be overwritten
- required secrets or environment prerequisites
- risk notes for enabled MCP or plugin capabilities

### Installer targets

The installer should support at least these targets:

- `codex`
- `claude`
- `opencode`
- `cursor`

The first implementation must fully support `codex` and `claude`. Other targets may remain scaffold-level initially.

### Installer profiles

The first supported install profiles should be:

- `core`
- `developer`
- `security`
- `research`

Profile meaning:

- `core`: minimal safe workflow baseline
- `developer`: core plus main engineering skills and Codex runtime
- `security`: core plus security review, scanning, and guarded workflows
- `research`: core plus documentation, Exa, and deep research capabilities

### Installer components

Components should map to user-meaningful units rather than raw directories.

Minimum component families:

- `baseline:*`
- `workflow:*`
- `capability:*`
- `agent:*`
- `mcp:*`
- `plugin:*`
- `target:*`

Examples:

- `baseline:skills`
- `baseline:codex`
- `workflow:review`
- `workflow:qa`
- `capability:research`
- `capability:security`
- `mcp:core`
- `mcp:research`
- `plugin:opencode`
- `target:codex`

### Installer behavior rules

The installer must:

- be idempotent on repeated runs
- avoid mutating unrelated files
- separate source assets from generated assets
- refuse ambiguous installs
- fail fast on invalid manifests
- warn before overwriting user-edited files
- distinguish authored files from generated files

### Generated vs authored file handling

The installer must treat these as generated:

- `.agents/skills/**`
- generated metadata
- generated target config fragments

The installer must treat these as authored:

- `skills/**`
- `docs/**`
- `manifests/**`
- most `plugins/**`
- most `mcp/**`

Generated files may be safely rebuilt. Authored files must not be silently replaced.

### Installer security rules

The installer must never:

- enable telemetry by default
- inject live secrets into tracked files
- enable high-risk MCP servers by default
- install auto-approval behavior by default
- enable plugin hooks with side effects by default
- normalize plaintext secret files as the primary secret path

The installer must clearly label:

- which capabilities require secrets
- which capabilities broaden network access
- which capabilities execute local commands automatically
- which capabilities are experimental or unsafe-local

### Installer validation rules

Before apply, the installer must validate:

- manifests are internally consistent
- requested profile exists
- requested components exist
- target is supported
- required generated assets are buildable
- unsafe components are explicitly requested

### Installer state tracking

The installer should maintain install state so future runs can:

- detect what was previously installed
- compute upgrade or repair plans
- avoid duplicate writes
- show drift between installed and desired state

State may live under a target-specific metadata path, but must not contain secrets.

### Installer documentation requirements

The repository must document:

- supported targets
- supported profiles
- install examples
- dry-run examples
- how to remove or repair an install
- how generated artifacts are rebuilt
- how risky components are enabled explicitly

## Unified Skill Set For v1

### Core workflow skills

- `plan-product`
- `plan-architecture`
- `investigate`
- `review`
- `security-review`
- `qa-browser`
- `ship-release`
- `health-check`
- `checkpoint`
- `careful`
- `freeze`
- `guard`

### Core knowledge and support skills

- `tdd-workflow`
- `verification-loop`
- `coding-standards`
- `backend-patterns`
- `frontend-patterns`
- `api-design`
- `e2e-testing`
- `documentation-lookup`
- `deep-research`
- `exa-search`
- `dmux-workflows`
- `mcp-server-patterns`

### Skill mapping notes

- `plan-product` merges `office-hours`, `plan-ceo-review`, and `plan-design-review`
- `plan-architecture` merges `plan-eng-review`, `api-design`, and `backend-patterns`
- `security-review` merges gstack `cso` depth with ECC `security-review` checklisting
- `qa-browser` merges gstack browser QA with ECC Playwright-oriented testing
- `ship-release` merges gstack `ship` and `document-release` with ECC verification discipline

## Security Requirements

### Default safety posture

The unified system must default to:

- No telemetry enabled
- No networked analytics
- No auto-upgrade
- No auto-commit
- No auto-approve
- No broad MCP surface
- No secret placeholders committed into active config files

### Allowed default MCP baseline

Only lean, broadly useful MCP entries should be enabled by default:

- GitHub
- Context7
- Exa
- Memory
- Playwright
- Sequential Thinking

All other MCP servers must be cataloged but disabled by default.

### Destructive-action controls

The system must preserve guarded workflows for:

- recursive delete
- force push
- reset hard
- discard checkout or restore
- destructive database commands
- destructive infra commands

### Secret handling

The system must prefer:

1. Environment variables
2. User-managed secret stores
3. Explicit local config ignored by git only when necessary

The system must not normalize custom plaintext secret files as the primary recommended path.

### External execution controls

Any plugin, hook, or MCP behavior that:

- auto-runs commands
- opens browsers
- sends telemetry
- injects routing docs
- modifies git state
- broadens permissions

must be opt-in and clearly documented.

## MCP Specification

### Catalog fields

Each MCP server entry in `mcp/catalog.json` should include:

- `id`
- `description`
- `transport`
- `command` or `url`
- `args`
- `env`
- `risk_level`
- `requires_secrets`
- `default_enabled`
- `profiles`
- `notes`

### Profile intent

- `core`: safe default local engineering
- `research`: Exa, documentation, crawling, external research
- `browser`: Playwright and browser-task support
- `security`: security scanners and review helpers
- `unsafe-local`: experimental, localhost, or high-trust services

## Plugin Specification

Plugins are host adapters, not the source of truth for behavior.

Requirements:

- Keep plugin logic thin
- Do not encode core workflow semantics only inside plugins
- Any hook-like behavior must have a Codex-safe fallback path
- Default plugin mode is disabled or minimal

## Multi-Agent Specification

Carry forward ECC's role split:

- `explorer`: read-only evidence gathering
- `reviewer`: correctness, regression, and security review
- `docs-researcher`: primary-doc verification

These roles should exist in `.codex/agents/` and be referenced from `.codex/config.toml`.

## Build and Validation Requirements

The repository should provide scripts to:

- validate source skills
- generate `.agents/skills/`
- validate generated metadata
- validate manifests
- validate MCP catalog shape
- run secret scanning
- run dependency audit

## Non-Goals For v1

These should not be part of the first implementation slice:

- importing all 116 ECC skills
- porting all gstack skills
- supporting every external host equally
- preserving legacy hook parity
- implementing remote telemetry
- implementing browser extensions
- implementing full install automation before core structure is stable

## Success Criteria

The unified repository is successful when:

- Core workflow skills exist in `skills/`
- Codex-facing generated skills exist in `.agents/skills/`
- `.codex/` provides a lean working baseline
- MCP catalog and profiles are explicit and risk-labeled
- Plugin adapters are opt-in
- Security defaults are safer than both source repos
- The repo supports phased expansion without restructuring
